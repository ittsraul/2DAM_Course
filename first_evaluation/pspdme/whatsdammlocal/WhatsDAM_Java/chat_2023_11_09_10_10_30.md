5. **ChatGPT**: The error message indicates that there is a compilation error in the file `MsgHandler.java` at line 101. The error message specifically says that the variable `linia` cannot be found.

To fix this issue, you need to make sure that the variable `linia` is declared and initialized before being used in that line.

Here are the steps to fix the code:

1. Open the file `MsgHandler.java` and locate line 101.
2. Check if there is a variable named `linia` declared before line 101. If not, add the declaration statement at an appropriate location.
3. If the variable `linia` is already declared, ensure that it is properly initialized before line 101. If not, add the initialization statement.

For example, you can declare and initialize the variable `linia` before line 101 like this:

```java
String linia = ""; // or any appropriate initialization value
```

Make sure to choose the appropriate data type for the variable `linia` based on its usage.

Once you have made the necessary changes, save the file and recompile your code. The compilation error should be resolved if there are no other issues in the code.
